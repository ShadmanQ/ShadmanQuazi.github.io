Uhm, hi there! 

I'm taking a game programming class this semester and I'm using GitHub to host my files. We're learning JavaScript through the P5.js library, so everything I'm gonna be uploading is gonna be a series of HTML and sketch.js files.

Here's what I've got so far:

[Week 2: Interactive Scene] (https://shadmanquazi.github.io/interactivescene)
[Week 3: Random text] (https://shadmanquazi.github.io/tweetgenerator)

If you've found this I'm assuming you're able to find the rest of my files on your own as well. In that case, enjoy!
